--> I'm currently learning how to program using languages like Python and R. I am a Biotechnologist with deep interests in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Some concepts I have learned through my projects are data mining, protein network construction, gene ontology, and expression analysis. I'm currently working on creating a webpage for a genetic database for Parkinson's Disease patients in India.
